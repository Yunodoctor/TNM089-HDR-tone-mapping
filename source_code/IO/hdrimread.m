%       [img, hdr_info] = hdrimread(filename)
%
%       This function reads from a file with name filename an HDR image, if
%       the format can not be opened, it tries to open it as it was an LDR
%       image using imread from MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox.
%
%       NOTE: JPEG2000 file passed as input are meant to be compressed
%       using HDR JPEG-2000. 
%
%        Input:
%           -filename: the name of the file to open
%
%        Output:
%           -img: the opened image
%           -hdr_info: RGBE format extra datum such as: exposure, gamma, etc.
